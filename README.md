# SystemsTeam4

Team plan: 
Start with getting the UML diagram for use cases done, each member will take on one actor, work out all their use cases, we will then coallate this into a use case diagram

PLANNING AND DESIGN: Tasks to be divided among team members

  UML Use case diagram - This will coallate use case notes for each actor in a uml diagram with a system boundary
  
  UML Class diagram for initial information model - This will show all classes and their attributes, as well as their relations to other     classes (with end roles and multiplicities) - See Lecture 06: Information Modelling 
  
  UML Class diagram for normalised database - This will show all relationships in the initial information model in 4(?)NF, with identified   primary and foriegn keys - See Lecture 07: Database Design
  
  UML State machine diagram - Shows the design of the GUI, showing each screen as a state, and showing which actions are allowed in each     state 
  
IMPLEMENTATION: Tasks to be divided among team members

  Backend: Database implementation and SQL
  
  Backend: Java code 
  
  Frontend: Swing GUI
